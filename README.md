# WELCOME to my repository!
This is my repository for Visual Analytics in Cultural Data Science

The 4 folders 'assignment1', 'assignment2', 'assignment3', and 'finalproject' are the 4 projects constituting my portfolio for the exam in the course in the spring of 2022.

The 'utils' folder is prewritten Python code for different tasks. Some of the project scripts use the path to this folder to access the prewritten code. The Python code in the 'utils' folder is written by our course professor, Ross Deans -Kristensen-McLachlan.

## Repository structure
Each project folder has the following directory structure:

| Column | Description|
|--------|:-----------|
```in```| Input data should be added here.
```out``` | Output is saved here after running script.
```scr``` | Python scripts.
```requirements.txt``` | Required packages to download for running the script.
