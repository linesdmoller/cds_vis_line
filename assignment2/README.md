## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
*This project is assignment 2 in the supplementary course, 'Visual Analytics' in 'Cultural Data Science', at Aarhus University.*
- Link to assignment description: (https://github.com/CDS-AU-DK/cds-visual/blob/main/assignments/assignment2.md)

The assignment consists of two projects:
1. Pt 1: Logistic regression model
2. Pt 2: Neural Network model

The two projects and their output is saved in the same folder system as 'assignment2pt1.py' and 'assignment2pt2.py' in the 'scr' folder, and 'cl_report_pt1.txt' and 'cl_report_pt2.txt' in the 'out' folder. 

**Pt 1 task outline:**
- Load either the MNIST_784 data or the CIFAR_10 data (I choose the CIFAR_10 dataset)
- Train a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Print the classification report to the terminal and save the classification report to out/lr_report.txt

**Pt 2 task outline:**
- Load either the MNIST_784 data or the CIFAR_10 data (I choose the CIFAR_10 dataset)
- Train a Neural Network model using the premade module in neuralnetwork.py
- Print output to the terminal during training showing epochs and loss
- Print the classification report to the terminal and save the classification report to out/nn_report.txt

## METHODS:
x

## USAGE:
To run each of the two scripts in the terminal, navigate to the folder outside the 'src' folder and run, one of the two:
- python3 scr/assignment2pt1.py
- python3 scr/assignment2pt2.py

## DISCUSSION OF RESULTS:
