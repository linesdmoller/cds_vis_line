## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
*This project is a self-assigned project submitted as a final project in the supplementary course, 'Visual Analytics' in 'Cultural Data Science', at Aarhus University.*

**Goal:**
The goal of this project was to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network model to predict classes of the hand gestures; 'rock', 'paper' and 'sciccors', based on a dataset of multiple images illustrating the same three hand gestures (according to the comonly known game; 'Rock, Paper, Scisssors'). I then want to evaluate the model's performance by making and saving a png of the history plot from the training session and a txt of the classification report.

## METHODS:
The dataset used in this project stems from; (https://www.kaggle.com/code/quadeer15sh/tf-keras-cnn-99-accuracy/data).

I approach the goal of this project by using TensorFlow's keras model to build the architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network. The model consists of 2 convolutional layers and one fully-connected classification layer. In order to train a better model, I use data augmentation techniques to slightly distort the images in the dataset to make them more diverse images (i.e. flipping, shifting, zooming, rotating, etc. the images). I train the model using 50 epochs. However, for a quick run of the script, 5 or 10 epochs also results in an acceptable accuracy in the model's predictions.

## USAGE:
In order to reporduce this project, one must first download the input dataset from here, [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/quadeer15sh/tf-keras-cnn-99-accuracy/data), and add the data to the 'in' folder in this project. One might also need to delete the blank file.

To run this script in the terminal, navigate to the folder outside the 'src' folder and run:

python3 scr/finalproject.py

## DISCUSSION OF RESULTS:
The output of this project is;
- A txt file containing the classification report (see [Link](https://github.com/linesdmoller/cds_vis_line/blob/main/finalproject/out/cl_report.txt)).
- A png file containg the history plot from the training session (see [Link](https://github.com/linesdmoller/cds_vis_line/blob/main/finalproject/out/his_plt.png))
